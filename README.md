# Music-Detection-and-Generation
An AI-powered system for real-time music analysis, instruments classification, and automated music generation using deep learning. Combines LibROSA, LSTMs, MuseGANs, and web technologies like React, Tone.js, and TensorFlow Serving to explore the creative potential of machine-generated music.

## 🚀 Features

- 🎧 Detects musical features from audio (tempo, beat, melody, genre)
- 🧠 Uses LSTM and MuseGAN for music generation
- 🗂 Extracts audio features using LibROSA
- 🌐 Real-time frontend with React, Tailwind CSS, Tone.js, and Meyda
- 🔌 Backend with Node.js + Express for API handling
- 📦 Model inference via TensorFlow Serving

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Deep Learning**: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras
- **Audio Processing**: LibROSA, Tone.js, Meyda
- **Frontend**: React, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
